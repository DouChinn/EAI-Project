# Research Proposal ðŸ“ƒ

## Background
Emotion articifial intelligence (EAI) refers to the techniques designed to recognize, analyse, and interpret human emotions. Combining the psychological knowlege of human emotions and machine learing techniques, EAI aims to gap the bridge between humnan emotions and machines by enabling machine to process emotion cues. Technology has always been a double-edged sword, though. The discourse surrounding the application of Emotion AI (EAI) is characterized by tension and polarization. 

Althought it is a relatively nascent field, the discouse and research with respect to EAI in the context of workplace have been in a full swing. 
in the workplace,  
This research aim to explore and understand the students' perceiption and recognition of EAI by conducting surveys and open-ended interviews (N=5~10). developing researchers understanding of current student group's AI literacy together with 


Machine learning? The most wise and efiicient way to enable "machine leanrning" is to make them "learn" in human's way.
