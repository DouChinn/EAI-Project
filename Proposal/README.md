## Introduction
Emotion artificial intelligence (EAI) refers to the techniques designed to recognize, analyze, and interpret human emotions. Combining the psychological knowledge of human emotions with machine learning techniques, EAI aims to bridge the gap between human emotions and machines by enabling machines to process emotion cues. Technology has always been a double-edged sword, though. The discourse surrounding the application of EAI is characterized by tension and polarization.

AI is a typical technological advancement that supports the workplace by automating organizational decisions and monitoring. Although EAI is a relatively nascent field, the discourse and research about EAI in the context of the workplace are rapidly advancing. However, limited comprehensive studies are focusing on the EAI literacy of student groups, particularly recent graduates who are about to enter the workplace and directly experience the impact of EAI. This is a significant oversight considering the crucial role they play in shaping the future of organizations and their ability to effectively leverage AI technologies. To this end, we address the following research questions:

* RQ1: What are the UCI computer science students' general perceptions and attitudes towards EAI?
* RQ2: How can educational institutions better prepare students for the integration and utilization of EAI technologies in the future?

Due to the time and capacity restrictions, this study only experiments at the scale of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) campus with a sample of approximately ten computer science student participants. Future work can study how these perceptions vary across wider and different demographic groups and educational backgrounds. This includes a consideration of demographic and educational factors that may influence students' perceptions of EAI and the expanded question allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the students' perspectives and helps identify potential variations in their attitudes towards EAI.

## Methodology

### Research Methodology
Explain the research design and methods you will employ for your investigation. Since you plan to study a small sample of 5-10 students, qualitative research methods may be more appropriate. Consider using semi-structured interviews or focus group discussions to gather in-depth insights and opinions. Justify why this methodology is suitable for exploring students' perceptions.

### Sampling Strategy
Describe your sampling strategy and the criteria for participant selection. Since you have a small sample size, consider purposive sampling, selecting students who have varying levels of familiarity with Emotion AI. Explain how this strategy will enable you to capture diverse perspectives.

### Data Collection
Detail the data collection process, including the methods you will use, such as interviews or focus groups. Explain how you will ensure participant privacy and obtain informed consent. Outline any ethical considerations and approval processes you will follow, such as obtaining consent from the participants and seeking approval from your institution's ethics committee.



## Analysis
Explain how you will analyze the collected data to derive meaningful insights. For qualitative data, consider using thematic analysis, where you identify recurring themes and patterns in participants' responses. Provide a brief overview of any software or tools you plan to use for analysis.



## Timeline
Create a timeline that outlines the different stages of your research project, including data collection, analysis, and report writing. Allocate realistic time frames for each stage to ensure smooth progress.



## Limitations
Acknowledge any limitations or constraints that may affect the generalizability or scope of your study. For instance, the small sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings. Discuss how you will address or mitigate these limitations.

## Significance and Expected Outcomes
Clearly articulate the potential contributions of your research. Explain how the findings will advance the current understanding of students' perception of Emotion AI and inform future educational practices. Emphasize the practical implications and potential benefits of your study's outcomes.
