## Introduction
Emotion articifial intelligence (EAI) refers to the techniques designed to recognize, analyse, and interpret human emotions. Combining the psychological knowlege of human emotions and machine learing techniques, EAI aims to gap the bridge between humnan emotions and machines by enabling machine to process emotion cues. Technology has always been a double-edged sword, though. The discourse surrounding the application of Emotion AI (EAI) is characterized by tension and polarization. 

Althought it is a relatively nascent field, the discouse and research with respect to EAI in the context of workplace have been in full swing.  
in the workplace,  
The Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) scholarship have long been interested in the implications of technology integration in the workplace. Technological advancements have supported workplaces in digital transformations of their processes by incorporating AI to augment and automate organizational decisions and to monitor and manage workers [74, 90, 123, 132, 152].

This research aim to explore and understand the students' perceiption and recognition of EAI by conducting surveys and open-ended interviews (N=5~10). developing researchers understanding of current student group's AI literacy together with 





Begin with an introduction that explains the significance and relevance of the research topic. Provide background information on Emotion AI and its potential impact on education. Highlight the need to understand students' perception to improve its implementation. Clearly state the research objectives and research questions that will guide your study.

## Methodology

### Research Methodology
Explain the research design and methods you will employ for your investigation. Since you plan to study a small sample of 5-10 students, qualitative research methods may be more appropriate. Consider using semi-structured interviews or focus group discussions to gather in-depth insights and opinions. Justify why this methodology is suitable for exploring students' perceptions.

### Sampling Strategy
Describe your sampling strategy and the criteria for participant selection. Since you have a small sample size, consider purposive sampling, selecting students who have varying levels of familiarity with Emotion AI. Explain how this strategy will enable you to capture diverse perspectives.

### Data Collection
Detail the data collection process, including the methods you will use, such as interviews or focus groups. Explain how you will ensure participant privacy and obtain informed consent. Outline any ethical considerations and approval processes you will follow, such as obtaining consent from the participants and seeking approval from your institution's ethics committee.



## Analysis
Explain how you will analyze the collected data to derive meaningful insights. For qualitative data, consider using thematic analysis, where you identify recurring themes and patterns in participants' responses. Provide a brief overview of any software or tools you plan to use for analysis.



## Timeline
Create a timeline that outlines the different stages of your research project, including data collection, analysis, and report writing. Allocate realistic time frames for each stage to ensure smooth progress.



## Limitations
Acknowledge any limitations or constraints that may affect the generalizability or scope of your study. For instance, the small sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings. Discuss how you will address or mitigate these limitations.

## Significance and Expected Outcomes
Clearly articulate the potential contributions of your research. Explain how the findings will advance the current understanding of students' perception of Emotion AI and inform future educational practices. Emphasize the practical implications and potential benefits of your study's outcomes.
